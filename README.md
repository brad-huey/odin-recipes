# odin-recipes
In this project I created a webpage with a list of dishes that link to other wedpages with the recidpes to create the dishes and nutritional information.
### -Lasagna
### -Pizza Cupcakes
### -Pop-Tarts

I was able to add photos to each recipe page. Create ordered and unordered lists, and I am currently learning how commit comments work.

I thought about linking each recipe page back to the index, but that is a waste of time, easy to do, and I want to press forward with this now.
